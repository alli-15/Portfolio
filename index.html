    <p>
      During Grades 7 and 8, we studied general knowledge in TLE.
      In Grades 9 and 10, we were allowed to choose a major such as
      Baking and Pastry, ICT, or Agriculture. I chose <strong>Baking and Pastry</strong>
      as my specialization.

    <h3>SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL: Plaridel Integrated National High School</h3>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
    <p>
      I chose the <strong>STEM strand</strong>. Our research focused on
      <strong>robotics</strong>, which gave me a background in coding
      and strengthened my interest in technology.

<!-- PROJECTS -->
<section class="section" id="projects">
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Project 1: FISHMAP (Fish Identification, Sorting, and Health Monitoring with Automated Processes)</h3>
    <p>
        enhances aquaculture efficiency by automating fish identification, classification, and freshness detection. The system reduces manual labor, increases sorting accuracy, and enables early freshness assessment, leading to improved fish quality and higher yield. Real-time monitoring and automated processes streamline operations, minimizing human error and optimizing resource use. Performance evaluations confirm FISHMAP’s reliability, making it a valuable tool for modern aquaculture management.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h3>Project 2: EGGSTRACARE (Enhanced Growth and Germination System with Temperature Regulation and Advanced Camera-Assisted Real-time Egg Monitoring)</h3>
    <p>
        the EGGSTRACARE system is a major improvement in incubation technology beyond traditional systems in terms of growth rate, labor efficiency, and yield output. By accurately manipulating the environment in critical processes, it maximizes embryonic development and minimizes operating costs. The new technology has the potential to change the poultry industry by increasing production and decreasing labor and improving efficiency. The continuing progress needs to adopt these types of technologies for sustainable and profitable poultry production.
